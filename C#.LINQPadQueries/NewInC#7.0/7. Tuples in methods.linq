//Out parameters: Use is clunky (even with the improvements described above), 
//and they donâ€™t work with async methods.
//
//System.Tuple <...> return types: Verbose to use and require an allocation of a tuple object.
//
//Custom - built transport type for every method: A lot of code overhead for 
//a type whose purpose is just to temporarily group a few values.
//
//Anonymous types returned through a dynamic return type: High performance 
//overhead and no static type checking.
